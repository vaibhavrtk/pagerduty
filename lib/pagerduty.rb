  # Send PagerDuty a trigger event to report a new or ongoing problem. When

  #
  # @option options [String] :dedup_key Identifies the incident to which
  #   this trigger event should be applied. If there's no open (i.e. unresolved)

  #   open incident with a matching key, this event will be appended to that
  #   incident's log. The event key provides an easy way to "de-dup" problem
  #   reports. If this field isn't provided, PagerDuty will automatically open a

  #
  # @option options.payload [String] :timestamp The time at which the emitting

  #   that is responsible for the event, for example mysql or eth0
  #
